The rpm/ directory contains a spec file to create RPM files.

The `./pkg` script builds the rpm package from this spec file. You can override
version by passing it as first argument: `./pkg 2.0`. The rpm is saved in usual
rpmbuild location.

A `docker-compose.yml` file is shipped to generate rpm in a clean environment.
Pass the wanted version as `run` argument : `docker-compose run --rm rpmbuild
2.0`. The RPM file is saved in `noarch/` directory.
