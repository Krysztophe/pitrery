The rpm/ directory contains a spec file to create RPM files.

To build a rpm:
- copy the spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
- copy the patch to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
- go to https://github.com/dalibo/pitrery and download a tarball.
  put it in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
- edit the spec file to change anything needed to match the version
  you got.
- run rpmbuild on the spec file as usual
