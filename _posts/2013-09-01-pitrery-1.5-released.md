I am very pleased to announce the release of version 1.5 of pitrery. It comes with great features, here is the changelog:

  * Force the checkpoint on `pg_start_backup()` when possible
  * Support `rsync` for the base backup. `tar` remains the default with a
    new `-s` option for backup_pitr and the `STORAGE` configuration
    variable
  * Save configuration files if they are outside of `PGDATA`
  * Rename `pitr_mgr` to `pitrery`, with a symlink for backward
    compatibility
  * Make the time based purge compatible with the count purge,
    allowing to purge backups based on age _and_ keeping a minimum
    number of backups
  * Make the old WAL purge better by comparing parts of the file name
    instead of the whole. Bash does not handle well the full file name
    when converted to a number (too big)
  * Safely purge old `.backup` files. Always keep `.history` files
  * Improve documentation
  * Better check the input file in `archive_xlog`
  * Use `rsync` to safely transfer to the remote host in `archive_xlog`
  * Document compression tools options
  * Add a verbose mode to list, with sizes and locations
  * Allow to specify the oid of a tablespace when give path for relocation:
    `-t oid:/new/path` or `-t name:/new/path is possible`

The release is available in the [downloads] page.
