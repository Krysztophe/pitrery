pitrery 1.12 has just been released.

This new version adds some new features and improvements:

* Fix the restore so that the backup_label is restored when used with
  PostgreSQL 9.6. Users of version 1.11 are encouraged to upgrade as
  theirs backups won't be restored properly unless they copy the backup_label
  file from the backup manually.

* New -m option for archive_xlog to chmod the archived file to the
  specified octal permission bits

The CHANGELOG file in the source code contains a more complete list of
changes in this version.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade]
page for more information.
