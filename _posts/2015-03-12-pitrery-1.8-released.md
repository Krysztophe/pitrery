I am very pleased to announce the release of version 1.8 of pitrery.

Apart from some bug fixes, the major changes of this release is the option to overwrite target directories when restoring base backups. The feature is available with the `-R` option of the `restore` action. Used with the rsync storage method, it allows to only transfer the diffs like any regular user of rsync would expect. This may save a lot of time for restores of big PostgreSQL installs.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade] page for more information.
