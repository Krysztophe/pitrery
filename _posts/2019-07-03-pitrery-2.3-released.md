pitrery is a set of Bash scripts to manage PITR backups for PostgreSQL.

pitrery automates Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery
(PITR) as much as possible with the following goals:

* Handle only PITR. log-shipping and replication are out of scope
* Be as minimally intrusive as possible for archiving

It is free software licensed under the PostgreSQL License and works
with all supported versions of PostgreSQL.

This new version adds some new features and improvements:

* Bugfixes

* Enhancements for the check command

pitrery has support for PostgreSQL up to 11 included.

Feedback & contributions are welcome.

pitrery is sponsored by Dalibo, the leading PostgreSQL company in
France, providing support, trainings and consulting to its customers
since 2005. The company contributes to the PostgreSQL community in
various ways, including: code, articles, translations, free
conferences and workshops
