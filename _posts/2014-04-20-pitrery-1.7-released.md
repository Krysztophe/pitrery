I am very pleased to announce the release of version 1.7 of pitrery.

Apart from some bug fixes, there are some mojor changes:

* The post backup hook, available through `POST_BACKUP_COMMAND`, is now run whatever the outcome of the backup, as long as the pre backup hook has been run.  The new variable `PITRERY_EXIT_CODE` is made available to the command to let it know if the backup have failed or succeeded.
* The `pitr_mgr` symlink, being kept for backward compatibility since version 1.5, have been removed. Use `pitrery` instead.

The new feature of this version is the possibility to choose how backups are compressed when using the tar storage method.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade] page for more information.
