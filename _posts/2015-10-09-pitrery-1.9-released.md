pitrery 1.9 has just been released.

In version 1.9, configuration of the restore\_command through the
restore\_xlog script is handled with the configuration file. WAL file
compression options have been renamed to avoid confusion, and messages
can now be timestamped.

The CHANGELOG file in the source code contains a more complete list of
changes in this version.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade] page for more information.
