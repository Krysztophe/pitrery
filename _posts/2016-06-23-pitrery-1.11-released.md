pitrery 1.11 has just been released.

This new version adds some new features and improvements:

* Improve how paths are handled so that spaces and weird characters in
  paths do not make it crash.

* New action "configure" that creates a configuration file from the
  command line with options used in most of the use cases.

* New action "check" to ensure a configuration is correct.

* New dry run option for the "purge" action.

* Support the new backup API of PostgreSQL 9.6, with the ability to
  backup from a hot standby server.

* Improvements on the documentation, including manpages and French translation.


The CHANGELOG file in the source code contains a more complete list of
changes in this version.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade]
page for more information.
