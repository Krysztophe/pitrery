I am very pleased to announce the release of version 1.6 of pitrery.

Few things have changed since 1.5, the only new feature is possibility to run
the backup action on a hot standby server without error. When launched on a hot
standby server using cron, the backup action exists silently, thus no mail is
send. This way the backup job is ready when a failover to this hot standby
server happens.

The release is available in the [downloads] page.
