pitrery 1.13 has just been released.

This is a bugfix release, including the following fixes:

* Fix tablespaces links being overwritten by postmaster on 9.5 due to
  tablespace_map. This conflicted with our tablespace relocation

* Fix the purge of WAL file that would remove all archives if the stop
  file is missing

* Fix backups failing due to incorrect parsing of the stop time when
  iso8601 timestamps are used

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade]
page for more information.
