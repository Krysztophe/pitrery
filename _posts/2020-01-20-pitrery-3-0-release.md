pitrery is a set of Bash scripts to manage PITR backups for PostgreSQL.

### New feature

* Support for PostgreSQL 12

PostgreSQL in this version has changed how recovery configuration is managed.
There is be no more "recovery.conf" file:
  - The recovery configuration keys are read from the postgresql.conf file.
     Upon restoration, recovery.conf settings are written by pitrery at the
     end of the postgresql.conf file.
  - A "recovery.signal" or "standby.signal" will be used by the restored
    cluster to know what action to take
     A new option is declared: RESTORE_MODE (or the "-m" switch). For
     restoration, it must be set either to "recovery" or "standby".
  - Multiple conflicting recovery_target* specifications are not allowed.
    PostgreSQL will make the check on startup.
  - We now advance to the latest timeline by default.

* Rename "xlog" to "wal"

Since PostgreSQL version 10, "xlog" has been renamed to "wal". Make this change
in pitrery:
  - "archive_xlog" script is renamed to "archive_wal".
  - "restore_xlog" script is renamed to "restore_wal".
  - configuration key PGXLOG is renamed to PGWAL.
  - the WAL archive directory ARCHIVE_DIR is set by default to:
    "$BACKUP_DIR/archived_wal".
  - deb and rpm packages will maintain symbolic link to old "xlog" scripts.
