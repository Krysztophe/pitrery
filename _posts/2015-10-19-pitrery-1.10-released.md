pitrery 1.10 has just been released.

This version corrects a bug where SSH user and host were not used by
restore_xlog when this information was only in the configuration
file. While some extra configuration could make it work, it prevented
the restore to work out of the box in 1.9.

The CHANGELOG file in the source code contains a more complete list of
changes in this version.

The release is available in the [downloads] page. See the [upgrade]
page for more information.
