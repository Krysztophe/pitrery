pitrery 1.8
===========

  * Exclude temporary locations from backup

  * Support pax to create hardlinks, for better portability. GNU cp
    stays the default, the configuration goes to the Makfile.

  * Add a -V switch to the pitrery wrapper script to show the version.

pitrery 1.7
===========

  * Show the storage method and compression suffix when listing
    backups in verbose mode.

  * Allow configuration of compression tools used when storing backup
    contents using tar.

  * Remove the `pitr_mgr` symlink.

  * Have `archive_xlog` create the local target directory so that we don't
    end up archiving on the same path, when the user forget to create it.

  * Run backup hook command even if the backup fails. The exit code of the
    backup is available to the hook in the PITRERY_EXIT_CODE env variable.

  * Bugfix on sed -E vs sed -r, use the later for older GNU sed.


pitrery 1.6
===========

  * Exit without error when backup is run on a hot standby
    server. Issue a warning message when run interactively, so an
    active cron job does not send any mail.

  * Bugfixes and improvements on documentation


pitrery 1.5
===========

  * Force the checkpoint on pg_start_backup() when possible

  * Support rsync for the base backup. tar remains the default with a
    new -s option for backup_pitr and the STORAGE configuration
    variable

  * Save configuration files if they are outside of PGDATA

  * Rename `pitr_mgr` to `pitrery`, with a symlink for backward
    compatibility

  * Make the time based purge compatible with the count purge,
    allowing to purge backups based on age _and_ keeping a minimum
    number of backups

  * Make the old WAL purge better by comparing parts of the file name
    instead of the whole. Bash does not handle well the full file name
    when converted to a number (too big)

  * Safely purge old .backup files. Always keep .history files

  * Improve documentation

  * Better check the input file in archive_xlog

  * Use rsync to safely transfer to the remote host in archive_xlog

  * Document compression tools options

  * Add a verbose mode to list, with sizes and locations

  * Allow to specify the oid of a tablespace when give path for relocation:
    -t oid:/new/path or -t name:/new/path is possible


pitrery 1.4
===========

  * Merge archiving configuration with pitr_mgr configuration

  * Add search for configuration file on its basename in archive_xlog
    and restore_xlog

  * Add more options to restore to configure the restore_command

  * Fix hang on purge when all backups are removed

  * Fix on tablespace handling when no tablespaces exist

  * Add an UPGRADE documentation

  * Copy docs and configuration to the documentation directory


pitrery 1.3
===========

  * Support PostgreSQL 9.2

  * Relocation of tablespaces on restore

  * Simpler archiving script, only archive to one place

  * Support for username on SSH connections

  * Better display of the list of backups

  * Add a summary of all information needed for a restore

  * Add a dry run mode on restore

  * Lots of bug fixes


pitrery 1.2
===========

This version is buggy, do not use it.


pitrery 1.1
===========

  * Fix backup selection date. Now backups are selected based on the
    end of the base backup, a base backup is not usable until the time
    of pg_stop_backup(), written as STOP TIME in the backup label.

  * Correct the filtering of archived WAL segments when purging, to
    avoid other files to get in the way.

  * Add a cleaning of the backup directory in case the backup fails.

  * Add Debian packaging


pitrery 1.0
===========

  * First version
