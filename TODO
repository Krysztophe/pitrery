TODO

- general:
  . (v1.3+) Reorganise with subdirectories
  . (v1.3+) Support for Major BSD Systems (ifconfig, stat?, grep -q?, mktemp?...)

- restore_pitr:
  . (v1.3+) Add an option to force overriding contents of non empty directories

- list_pitr:
  . (v1.3+)  Add an option to list the content of the backup and give more info
            like the directory to create for tablespaces, sizes,...

- backup_pitr:
  . (v1.3)  Consider creating a tar of extra files/directories from an arbitrary
            list, this would allow to store postgres binaries and init script
            for example.

- purge_pitr:
  . (v1.3)  Make the time based purge compatible with the count purge, allowing
            to purge backups based on age _and_ keeping a minimum number of
            backups.

- upgrade steps from 1.1 to 1.2:
  . add a script to generate $backup_dir/backup_timestamp from the stop time of
    the current backup where it does not exists : restore_xlog?
