TODO / Roadmap

- general:

- list_pitr:
  . (v1.5)  Add an option to list the content of the backup and give more info
            like the directory to create for tablespaces, sizes,...

- backup_pitr:
  . (v1.5)  Save configuration files if they are outside of PGDATA
  . (v1.5)  Support rsync for the base backup

- purge_pitr:
  . (v1.5)  Make the time based purge compatible with the count purge, allowing
            to purge backups based on age _and_ keeping a minimum number of
            backups.
  . (v1.5)  Make the wal purge better by comparing parts of the xlog file name
            instead of the whole while bash does not handle well when converted
            to a number.
  . (v1.5)  Find a way to safely purge old .backup and .history files
