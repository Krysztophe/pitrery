TODO

- general:
  . (v1.3+) Support for Major BSD Systems (ifconfig, stat?, grep -q?, mktemp?...)
  . (v1.4)  Install the doc in the makefile and packages
  . (v1.4)  Rename pitr_mgr to pitrery with a symlink for backward compat
  . (v1.5)  Support rsync for the base backup

- restore_pitr:
  . (v1.3+) Add an option to force overriding contents of non empty directories

- list_pitr:
  . (v1.3+)  Add an option to list the content of the backup and give more info
            like the directory to create for tablespaces, sizes,...

- backup_pitr:
  . (v1.4)  Consider creating a tar of extra files/directories from an arbitrary
            list, this would allow to store postgres binaries and init script
            for example.

- purge_pitr:
  . (v1.3)  Make the time based purge compatible with the count purge, allowing
            to purge backups based on age _and_ keeping a minimum number of
            backups.
